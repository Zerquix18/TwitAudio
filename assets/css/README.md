Styles!
========

In the `styles.json` file you'll see the list of styles.

If the site isn't live, then PHP will insert all these styles
in the header.

If the site is live, then they'll all be minified in 2 files: `app.css` and `vendor.css`.

Check [re-update.sh](https://github.com/superjd10/TwitAudio/tree/master/re-update.sh) to see how they get minified.
