<strong id="q1">1. Why can I not upload voice notes?</strong>

<p>Not all browsers support that webpages access to the microphone, specially Safari and Internet Explorer. When that's the case, there's nothing we can do. If you want to record voice notes and your browser does not support audio recording, you will have either to update your browser or install a new one. The common browsers that supports audio recording are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Google Chrome (version 21 or higher)</li>
	<li>Mozilla Firefox (version 17 or higher)</li>
	<li>Edge (version 12 or higher)</li>
	<li>Opera (version 18 or higher)</li>
	<li>Android Browser (version 44 or higher)</li>
	<li>Opera mobile (version 12 or higher)</li>
	<li>UC Browser for Android (version 9.9 or higher)</li>
	<li>Google Chrome for Android (version 46 or higher)</li>
	<li>Mozilla Firefox for Android (version 41 or higher)</li>
	<li>BlackBerry Browser (version 10 or higher)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you cannot update/install one of those browsers, you still have the option to record your voice note with your phone/PC and upload it to TwitAudio through the option to upload an audio file.</p>
