<h2>About TwitAudio</h2>


<p>Twitaudio is a website which allows users to upload voice notes and audio files to Twitter and also listen to them from the Twitter's website or applications using Twitter Audio Cards. It was developed by <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/zerquix18">@Zerquix18</a> on October 2015.</p>

<p>The functioning is pretty easy: Users log in with their Twitter accounts, using the Twitter API. When they are registered, they have two options: Record a voice with their microphone, or upload an audio file with one of the following extensions: <em>aac, m4a, mp3, ogg or wav.</em></p>

<p>The audios have a limit size of 50 megabytes and 2 minutes, for storage reasons. After a user uploads a file, it is able to cut the file if it reaches the 2 minutes limit. After they press post, the audio is automatically sent to Twitter (if the user checks the option) and posted to the website.</p>

<p><strong>Twitaudio is not affiliated to Twitter.</strong> Twitaudio's service is intended to supplement or enhance the service provided by Twitter Inc. at <a href="http://twitter.com.">http://twitter.com.</a></p>
