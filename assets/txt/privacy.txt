<h3>Basic account information</h3>
<p>If you desire to access to some features of the website, you must register an account in our website using Twitter API. The information included in the registration includes your IP address, and the data shown in the profiles (excepting posted audios and favorited audios). This information is provided by you when you authorize TwitAudio's application using your Twitter account. On Twitaudio's services, some information like your Twitter profile picture, biography, username and name are listed publicly, just as it is on Twitter. This information is re-updated everytime you log in on Twitaudio.</p>
<h3>Log Data</h3>
<p>When you visit Twitaudio, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data" ). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of Twitaudio and of our Service, and for the Twitaudio's technical administration. We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except in case of violation of the Terms of Service.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Depending on how you’re accessing Twitaudio, we may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Twitaudio account or your browser) or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Twitaudio settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit Twitaudio. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Twitaudio account, and other cookies are not. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. However, you can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie.</p>

<p>We may allow advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you within Twitaudio's Sites, Services and Software. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons. If you would like to contact the advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies with which we have relationships to learn more about their privacy policies and what options (if any) they offer to opt out of their data collection, please visit their web site(s). You may find a list of links to these companies' Web sites <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/advertising/solutions-for-bloggers/privacy/3rd-party-list/index.html">here</a>. Some of these companies are participants in the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. You can learn more about NAI and how you may "opt out" of targeted advertising delivered by NAI member ad networks <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">here</a>.</p>
