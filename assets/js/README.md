Scripts!
========

In the `scripts.json` file you'll see the list of scripts.

If the site isn't live, then PHP will insert all these scripts
in the footer.

If the site is live, then they'll all be minified in 2 files: `app.js` and `vendor.js`.

Check [re-update.sh](https://github.com/superjd10/TwitAudio/tree/master/re-update.sh) to see how they get minified.
